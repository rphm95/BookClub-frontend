## The Project
- BookClub is a web application developed out of scratch with a language I taught myself for the capstone project of General Assembly Bootcamp. I've chosen to work with Java and Spring for my backend.
With this app the user is able to either get ideas for books, or use the platform to keep track of books to read or the ones they've already read.


<!-- ## Difficulties:
<!-- ### bugs:
-  --> -->

## What I would have liked to add:
- In the future I would like to refacture the possibility of adding an user login, so the books displayed can be specific for each user.
